**Every writing system is equally descriptive and prescriptive**
The official IPA (International Phonetics Association) symbols are useful for academic accuracy, but utterly useless for practical writing purposes like an alphabet of a language. To represent every base vowel of 95 % of native speakers of all languages the Standard Latin Alphabet with 6 letters generally used for vowels (A, E, I, U, O, Y) would only need another 6 additional vowel letters: Ʌʌ, Ɵɵ, Ʉᵾ, Ɔɔ, Ɛɛ and Ⳟⳟ (the box symbol in the left graph, blame Google for poor rendering). That figure would jump to 99 % by adding two more vowel letters: Ұ & Э. Similarly, 46 base consonants can describe sufficiently the sounds of the vast majority of the world's languages.
## Notable features
- Latin-Greek-Cyrillic-based and IPA inspired alphabet with 14 vowels and 46 consonants and 9 articulatory modifiers.
- Used to write every language in the past, present and, hopefully, future.
- Keyboard configuration: All 60 base letters accessible on most QWERTY AND AZERTY variants.
- The sounds represented by each letter are the initial sounds of the things they depict, using the acrophonic principle.
## Vowels
### Transphonologization
Diacritics representing [nasalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasalization), [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics), and [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics))/[pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch-accent_language) accessible via upper modifier key (◌̣̌≀): ◌̰̃, ◌̭̌ (toggle) and ◌̣̇, respectively. On keyboard, tone diacritics have a toggleable priority, since they share the horizontal numerical keys with numbers. Nasalization and stress/pitch are binary features (on or off). At least one of these three features is phonemic in about half of the world's langs. Depending on the selected language one of these features is configured to first priority for the modifier key: Tone toggle key for Mandarin, nasalisation for Hindi, and stress/pitch for Russian (should they care to mark it since its phonemic) for example. One grapheme box (the space a symbol occupies on a row) fits two diacritics, one above and one below.
#### Nasalization [~]
Occurs across language families. Usually restricted to vowels. Phonemic in French, Portuguese, Albanian, Wu, Jin, Min Nan, Indo-Aryan, Acehnese, Burmese, Hmong, Tamil, many West-African, and Nilo-Saharan langs. Denoted with a tilde above {◌̃} or below {◌̰}.
#### Tonality
Occurs everywhere except where white people live. Usually between 3 to 6 inherent pitch contours. Denoted with:
- vertical line above {◌̍} for a high tone
- vertical line below {◌̩} for a low tone
- acute accent {◌́} for a rising tone
- grave accent {◌̀} for a falling tone
- caron {◌̌} for a dipping tone
- circumflex {◌̂} for a peaking tone.
#### Stress & Pitch accent [•]
Very common, perhaps universal. Phonemic status not always certain. The French always stress the last syllable, while Finns always stress the first one. Slavs except for the Czech decided that stress would be phonemic and unpredictable. Even English has minimal pairs separated only by stress, compare for example: insight/incite, prȯject/projėct, desert/dessert, ̇object/objėct, prėsent/presėnt. Denoted with a dot above {◌̇} or below {◌̣}. 
## Extra vowels, Ұ & Э
Some langs like Acehnese distinguish four unrounded back vowels: Y [ɯ], Ұ [ɤ], ⵎ [ʌ], A [ä]. French *might* distinguish two rounded front vowels in addition to 'u' [y] {Ʉ}: j**eu**ne [ʒœn] (young) vs. j**eû**ne [ʒøn] (fast, verb), which could be denoted Ɵ [ø] & Э [œ]. Could be the only one its kind or just French shenanigans.
# Consonants
## Uncommon phonemes
Bottom legend letters accessible via central modifier key (◌̶ ) that for most base letters adds a strikethrough bar.

**Uvular consonants**: several langs distinguish at least one dorsal consonant at two places of articulation, velar and uvular: И [ŋ], K [k], Ԍ [g], X [x], 𑄷 [ɣ] <=> Ⳮ [ɴ], ₭ [q], G [ɢ], Ӿ [χ], ~~૪~~ [ʁ] respectively. Common contrast among Native American, Semitic, Berberic, Iranian, Turkic, Caucasian, Tungusic, and Hmongic langs.

**Dental consonants**: a few langs distinguish [n],[t],[d] at two adjacent places of articulation, dental and alveolar: Ꞥ, Ŧ, Ð <=> N, T, D, respectively

**Lateral alveolar fricatives, Ꞩ [ɬ] & Ƶ [ɮ]**: Common among Bantoid, Tibeto-Burman, Zhuang, Hmongic, Native American, Caucasian langs and Welsh.

**Lateral velar/uvular approximant [ʟ] or velarized alveolar approximant [ɫ], ᖶ**: a rare gem. Present in Kurdish, Albanian, Papuan langs, Berberic, and maybe Turkish.

**Voiceless alveolar trill, ᖉ [r̥]**: even rarer gem. Present in Tibetan, Chechen, Ingush, Welsh, Moksha, e.g.

**Labial trills, Γ [ʙ̥] & Ɐ [ʙ]**: extremely rare. Present in Native American, Oceanic, Bantoid, Papuan, and Tibeto-Burman langs. 
## Secondary Articulation
Adding 2ry articulation to base letters accessible via lower modifier key, ⴼ̥̊: [palatalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(phonetics) (◌ȷ), [retroflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant) (ɭ◌), [velarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarization) (◌̥), [glottalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottalic_consonant) (ſ◌), [breathy-voicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathy_voice) (◌ɿ) and [clicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant) (◌̊). The first three practically never occur in one language, and since they are physiologically mutually exclusive (cannot be produced simultaneously in one phoneme) they are denoted using the lower box. While [ɲ] occurs very commonly as the only palatal consonant besides J [j] across all language families, it can be analyzed and represented also as a nasalized palatal approximant {J̃}.

At most a language exhibits two 2ry articulations. Depending on the selected language one of these features is configurated to first priority for the modifier key.
### Palatalization
Besides [ɲ], occurs among several Indo-European langs as [ʎ], or as [c] and [ɟ] among Slavic, Uralic, Celtic, Bantoid langs. Also common in Albanian, Basque, Zhuang, and Jingpo. Polish and Russian palatalize all but two or three of their consonants. Denoted with a left hook below, ̡◌: {N}➝{Ɲ}.
### Retroflex consonants
Rare outside of Indo-Aryan languages. Analysed in contrast to the respective alveolar consonants. Denoted with a right hook below, ̡◌: {R}➝{Ɽ}.
### Velarization and Pharyngealization
Rare outside of Arabic, Berberic and Caucasian langs. Denoted with a ring below, ◌̥: {T}➝{T̥} (Arabic: {ت} ➝ {ط}).
### Glottalization
Rare outside of East-African, and Caucasian langs. Also present in Hausa, Fulani and some Indo-Aryan langs. Includes both ejective and implosive consonants. Denoted with a righ hook above, ◌ᣗ: {κ}➝{ƙ}.
### Breathy-voicing
Extremely rare in vowels. Analysed as aspiration in consonants, thus denoted with н {ᴘн, ᴛн, κн}. Phonemic in Dinka (Nilotic) and Mon (Austroasiatic). Denoted with a left hook above, ɿ◌: {ỏ}.
### Click consonants
Near exclusive to South-African Khoisan and Bantoid langs. Also present in three East-African langs: Sandawe, Hadza, and Dahalo. Denoted with a ring above, ◌̊: {T}➝{T̊}.
