**Every writing system is equally descriptive and prescriptive**
The official IPA (International Phonetics Association) symbols are useful for academic accuracy, but utterly useless for practical writing purposes like an alphabet of a language. To represent every base vowel of 95 % of native speakers of all languages the Standard Latin Alphabet with 6 letters generally used for vowels (A, E, I, U, O, Y) would only need another 6 additional vowel letters: Ʌʌ, Ɵɵ, Ʉᵾ, Ɔɔ, Ɛɛ and Ⳟⳟ (the box symbol in the left graph, blame Google for poor rendering). That figure would jump to 99 % by adding two more vowel letters: Ұ & Э. Similarly, 46 base consonants can describe sufficiently the sounds of the vast majority of the world's languages.
## Notable features
- Type of writing system: alphabet / abjad / abugida / syllabary (delete as appropriate)
- Direction of writing: left to right in horizontal lines (other directions are available)
- Used to write: English (or whatever language(s))
- The sounds represented by each letter are the initial sounds of the things they depict, using the acrophonic principle.
